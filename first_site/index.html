<h1>What it means to be a BME student</h1>

<h2> What does <strong> BME </strong> mean?  </h2>

<p> BME is the term used to denote <em> racialised </em> ethnic minorities. </p>
<p> Often, the BME experience is looked at through an american gaze, but this site aims to look at the <em> British </em> BME experience. </p>

<p> BME people have been in the UK since at least the tudor period, where black people were termed "<em> Blackamoores </em> ". </p>

<p> However, commonly the only history of BME people taught in British schools is to do with the Trans-Atlantic slave trade or colonialism. Even when focusing on slavery and colonialism, this is shown in a reverential manner, praising the <em> Great British empire </em> instead of looking how excrutiating life must have been for Black people at the time. </p>
